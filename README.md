# Notebooks

NOTE: this is a work-in-progress re-write of the layout of this repo.  If you are seeing this message and aren't sure whhy probably you are on the wrong branch - try master...

This repository contains a curated set of Jupyter notebooks related to the work that we do at STScI. These notebooks follow a consistent<sup>\*</sup> [style guide]( https://github.com/spacetelescope/style-guides/issues/2) in terms of layout/structure, coding conventions etc.

These notebooks are also under continuous integration to ensure that astronomers using these notebooks have a high level of confidence that they will work.

## Contents

This repository holds the notebooks themselves, but in a harder-to-read unexecuted form. If you want to view the notebooks online, you should view [the rendered version](https://spacetelescope.github.io/notebooks).
